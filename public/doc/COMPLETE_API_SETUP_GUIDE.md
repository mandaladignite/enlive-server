- Set up database backups
- Monitor performance
- Consider sharding for large datasets

### 4. Scaling Considerations
- Use load balancers
- Implement caching (Redis)
- Consider microservices architecture
- Set up monitoring and alerting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**
   - Check MONGODB_URI
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Verify network connectivity

2. **JWT Token Errors**
   - Check token secrets
   - Verify token expiration
   - Ensure proper token format

3. **Validation Errors**
   - Check request body format
   - Verify required fields
   - Check data types
